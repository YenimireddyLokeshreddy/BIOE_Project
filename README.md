Description:
This research uses Hybrid Deep Learning models to forecast the price of Apple stock.The deep learning models we used were CNN-Stacked-LSTM, CNN-Stacked-GRU, and an ensemble model of LSTM,GRU, and RNN.We are also providing a new feature sentiment score that takes into account Apple's new sentiment score.We used the Hugging faces FinBert model to get the emotion score.
